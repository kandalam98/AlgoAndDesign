Intuition
Palindromic Substring is a Dynamic Programming problem where you need to find the number of palindromic substrings in it. A palindromic is a word, phrase, or number, or other sequence of characters which read the same backward and forward.

For example: the string “aabaa” has 9 palindromic substrings: “a”, “a”, “aa”, “b”, “aba”, “a”, “a”, “aa”, “aabaa”. We can use various algorithms to solve this problem. Including dynamic programming, manacher’s algorithm, and others.

Approach
One straight forward approach is to generate all substrings of the string and check if substrings is a palindrome or not.

In this solution, I will only discuss about the brute-force solution that has a time complexity of O(n3)O(n^3)O(n
3
 ) and two dynamic programming solutions that take O(n2)O(n^2)O(n
2
 ) time.

Please keep in mind that the Manacher's Algorithm has the time complexity of O(n)O(n)O(n) and space complexity of O(n)O(n)O(n), where n is the length of the input string.


Its better to use the expand from center technique and check the palindrome and count the total
